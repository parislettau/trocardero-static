    <p>SHRADDHA BORAWAKE, DONGYAN CHEN, ROCHYNE DELANEY McNULTY, IVETTA SUNYOUNG KANG, SOPHIE MORROW, MARCIA VAITSMAN<br />
Across Pieces of Sky<br />
Curated by Corinna Berndt<br />
Gallery 2</p>
<p>23 June – 17 July<br />
Opening night: Wednesday 30 June, 6pm – 8pm<br />
Artist talk: tbc</p>
<p>Across Pieces of Sky brings together the discursive practices of five international and two local artists who met in 2019 during an artist residency in Berlin. The works in the exhibition contemplate ideas of friendship, language, social connectedness and our relationship to the environment in times of uncertainty. Featuring several videos, a collection of voice-recordings, and a participatory piece, the artists invite the audience to reflect upon the various relational networks that exist between gestures, people, and surrounding ecosystems. </p>

<p>Sophie Morrow (Australia)<br />

Morrow has exhibited in group and solo shows, both locally and internationally. She is currently undergoing research in the Master of Fine Art program at the Victorian College of the Arts. </p>
<p>Rochyne Delaney McNulty (England)<br />
Rochyne Delaney McNulty creates connections through small gestures of creativity. Sharing a passion, talent or skill with people who listen and are attentive. They create small networks cutting through distance and segregation. Rochyne realises they don’t have to be big acts; they can be quiet and slight. Creating a moment where genuine connection can grow and then spark a new gesture. Rochyne hopes by being a catalyst for these small acts, it can help people see the value in sharing, teaching, learning and making, for the sake of it. Rochyne’s practice occurs across disciplines, developing organically with the people and influences present with a focus on collaboration, connection and stories.</p>

<p>Dongyan Chen (Singapore / China)<br />
Dongyan Chen is a multidisciplinary fine artist, filmmaker and illustrator, currently based in Singapore. Her works are primarily concerned with the realm of the unconscious and dreams, as well as with the different processes of discovering and articulating the hidden messages embedded within the unconscious and dreams. Chen is interested in the potential of texts, images, and sounds and how these might work together in montages, as a way to construct fictional stories. The role languages play in our daily lives is an important element in Chen’s work. Being bilingual, she often uses both Mandarin and English texts in her work. Previously, her practice has been concerned with automatic writing, which later ignited her interest in exploring the relationship between languages and the human mind. Recently, she has become interested researching of Buddhist art, in particular she has been interested in the art found in Dunhuang Grottoes. As a video artist, Chen hopes to explore possibilities of presenting traditional art forms, such as murals, paintings, drawings, and sculptures through video art.</p>
<p>Corinna Berndt (Australia / Germany)<br />
Corinna Berndt lives and works in Naarm / Melbourne on unceded Wurundjeri land. Her practice incorporates digital media, video installation and collage. Influenced by her background in sculpture and spatial practice, her work addresses pre-conceived notions surrounding embodiment, materiality and disembodiment, when navigating the digital realm. Through experimenting with glitched media, poetics and fabulations, Berndt explores the various personal and often mythologised relationships that appear to continuously resurface between physical matter and seemingly intangible, digitalised information. Berndt is currently undertaking a PhD at the Victorian College of the Arts, Melbourne. Her research reflects upon generational perceptions of the potentialities and implications of digital technologies in the Western cultural imaginary.</p></div>
